You must create, on your own, a working mobile app that addresses some real
world problem.
For a full score your program MUST INCLUDE at least:
1) 1 COLLECTION TYPE (LIST) that is used in more than one location
2) 1 ALGORITHM WITH:
a) SEQUENCING (MULTIPLE LINES OF CODE)
b) SELECTION (IF/ELSE)
c) ITERATION (LOOP)
3) 1 PROCEDURE with a parameter (can be your algorithm)
VIDEO:
You must create a maximum 60 second video with no narrative sound (you can
make subtitles if you want) (you can include sounds your app makes) showing the
following:
● Input
● Program Functionality
● Output

WRITTEN RESPONSE FORMATTING:
Your graders are expected to follow the rubric. That being said, your graders are
human and will be grading about 100 papers a day (I know because I am a grader).
So you need to make sure that your program STANDS OUT in a good way. One
way of doing this is to make it EASIER for the grader.
Row 1:
● Bold the words “overall purpose” of the program
● Bold the words “functionality”
● Bold the words “input” and “output”

Row 2:
● Make sure your screenshots only show the collection type (list) and where
the list is used in the code
● Bold the name of the list you use when you are describing it in your written
response
● Bold the data contained in the list.
Row 3:
● Bold the words “manage[d] complexity”
● Bold the words “could not be written” or “this code would be written
differently, without using this list”
Row 4:
● Make sure your screenshots only show the procedure and where the
procedure is called in the code
● Bold the words “contributes to the overall functionality”
Row 5:
● Make sure your screenshot shows sequencing, selection and iteration
● Bold the words that show the beginning of each step of recreating your
algorithm i.e. “First”, “Step 1”, “Next” etc...
Row 6:
● Make sure your explanation shows two different calls of the procedure
● Bold the different conditions
● Bold your results
